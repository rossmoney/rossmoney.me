        I have over four years of experience in web development, using frameworks such as Laravel and Vue.js. I am also starting out as a DevOps Engineer with knowledge of AWS Cloud and Infrastructure as Code tools.
<br><br>
In my previous role I was working directly with the Senior DevOps Engineer, maintaining applications with Golang to support the business, and reporting on server logs and downtime via various channels and platforms.
<br><br>
In other roles I also contributed to developing and maintaining web-based applications to manage different aspects of business operations, such as CRM, sales, IT support, and recruitment. I have developed features such as finance integrations and call centre functionality, using APIs and third-party services. 
<br><br>
I am passionate about creating efficient, reliable, and user-friendly solutions that meet the needs and expectations of the clients and the users.
